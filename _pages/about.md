# Who am I?

Ronald Mariah is a Cloud Architect currently contributing to the architecture and development of modern Azure based systems at immedia, as well as .NET API development for our own products and those of our customers.
After joining immedia in 2017, Ronald worked for a few years on extending the data engine functionality of one of our clients’ vast data environments. Ronald was instrumental in our client’s major Cloud Migration project, which entailed the re-hosting of dozens of their services into the Microsoft Azure environment, as well as the simultaneous App Modernisation of many of their legacy systems to take advantage of the built-in optimisations of this Infrastructure-As-A-Service.
An Honours graduate in Computer Science at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Ronald is passionate about contributing to the communities in and around Durban.
