New enhancements to .NET 5 include smaller, faster single-file applications that use less memory, which are appropriate for microservices and containerized applications across operating systems.

The changes, which signify the latest step in unifying the .NET platform across workloads, also include significant performance improvements, support for Windows ARM64 and new releases of C# 9.0 and F# 5.0 languages. Developers can download the release candidate with a Go-Live license, enabling them to use it in production.

The .NET 5 Release Candidate is now feature-complete and will be generally available Nov. 10.
